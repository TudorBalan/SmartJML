# SmartJML

A SmartML to Java Card and SmartJML to JML translator.

A valid .sl file will automatically be translated to a valid .java file after being put into the /sources/ directory and running the main method located within Main.java.

The output can be found within the same directory and by loading the JMLTest.key file into KeY, any Java Card program from the /sources/ directory can be verified directly.
